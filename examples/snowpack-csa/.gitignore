# Svench is ignored for demo purposes:
/.svench/

# but in a real project you'll probably want to ignore only generated files:
/.svench/src/

# Actually, I would even recommend keeping the whole `.svench` directory under
# version control, to track change in your Svench structure, caused by changes
# in your `.svench` files and/or Svench version updates. A diff can surely help
# with troubleshooting, sometimes.
